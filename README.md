# Frontend Task

## Getting Started

* Run `yarn && yarn start` to install all dependencies and start the application.
* Go to [home(http://localhost:8080)](http://localhost:8080) to get started.

* Run `npm test` to run all tests.

## description
* This application is based on Antd which is one of the best React Component UI frameworks.
* In order to build clean code, I think we need to decouple the css from the component.
* Also in order to implement scoped styles for each component, I used styled-components.
